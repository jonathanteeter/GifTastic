# GifTastic
This project uses the GIFFY API (https://api.giphy.com) to make a dynamic web page populated with Animal GIFs of the user's choosing.  It's pure entertainment and performs no useful work.

## Design & Technology
* This project uses a responsive design with Bootstrap framework:
    * On startup, the user is presented with several preset buttons with animal labels.
    * The user selects an animal button of interest.
    * An API query is constructed by animal name, limit of 15, and associated API key.
    * An API response is returned with 15 animal images that are rendered to the screen.
    * The user can also create additional buttons with animals of their choosing.
    * Finally, the user can select each image displayed.  The image then toggles from still to animated.  (Future)
* Key technologies used to build this application are:
    * Bootstrap framework
    * HTML & CSS
    * JavaScript with jQuery library
    * API call using AJAX 

## Why the project is useful
This project provides a means to learn solid web development skills using the technologies listed.
