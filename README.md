# GifTastic
## What the project does
* This project uses an API call to https://api.giphy.com to search for the animal specified.  10 animal gifs are rendered to the screen in animated format.  
* It's pure entertainment and performs no useful work.  More importantly, this project provides a means to learn solid web development skills.

## Why the project is useful
The project was useful in combining multiple methods together to include javascript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, and CSS as introduced in class and learned through the assignments.
