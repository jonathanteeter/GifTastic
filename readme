What the project does:  This project is an exercise in using the API to "giffy.com" to search for, display,
and add image URLs to the DOM.

Why the project is useful:  Additional skills were learned and more importantly, how to bring various 
methods together as one program to perform various functions.

How users can get started with the project:  I was able to use the activities and what has previously been 
taught in class to complete this project.
